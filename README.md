# 🏌️ Golf Leaderboard Scraper & Insights Pipeline

This project uses **Puppeteer** and **ExcelJS** to scrape dynamic golf leaderboard data from a tournament website and convert it into structured Excel files. It’s designed as the **first step in a larger data insights pipeline**, enabling real-time analysis, reporting, and predictive modeling.

## 📌 What It Does

- Scrapes event title, date, player names, and scores  
- Expands each player's scorecard, even across multiple dropdowns  
- Writes structured data to an Excel file using ExcelJS  
- Supports multiple tournaments with built-in delays  

## 🧰 Built With

- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) – Headless browser automation for scraping dynamic content  
- [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) – Create and modify Excel files with JavaScript  
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golf-leaderboard-scraper.git
cd golf-leaderboard-scraper
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the scraper

Edit the URLs and file paths in `main()` as needed, then run:

```bash
node index.js
```

> The browser will launch in non-headless mode for debugging. Change `headless: true` to suppress UI.

## 📈 What's Next?

This scraping layer is the foundation for a full analytics pipeline:

* Power real-time dashboards
* Automate reporting and alerts
* Feed predictive models for performance forecasting
* Scale across sports or sites

## 📁 Output Example

Each `.xlsx` file includes:

* Event metadata
* Player name and score
* Round-by-round scorecards (pars and scores)
